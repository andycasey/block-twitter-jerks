block-twitter-jerks
===================

Block Twitter jerks, their jerk followers, and jerks they follow. 

Due to Twitter's rate limiting this script will pause for 60 seconds after each batch of jerks is blocked.

Once the script finishes running, a list of jerks is saved as a CSV file for your records if you ever wish to unblock a jerk.

### Installation

If you don't have tweepy, install the dependency.

`pip install tweepy`

Then run it

`python blockjerks.py`

#### Disclaimer

I take no responsibility for any blowback that stems from your jerk blocking activities.
